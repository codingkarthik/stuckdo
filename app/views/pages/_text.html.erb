<p>When you are hungry and want to eat in the first restaurant you see.... this is how I found this place since it was only 300 metres from me 😝 Trust me I didn't regret at all they served some really awesome Awadhi chicken curry 🍛 just loved it 😋 limited menu good in taste is the USP. Oh I forgot to mention it is rightly priced rather little cheaper than all the restaurants around. Try it guys !</p>
